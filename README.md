# Flutter & Dart Learning Journey

## What I Learned in 1 Day

1. **Everything is a Widget**
   - In Flutter, the building blocks of the UI are widgets.

2. **Class-based Widgeting Language**
   - Flutter uses Dart, a class-based language, to define widgets.

3. **Understanding `final` and `const`**
   - `final`: A single-assignment variable, can be set only once.
   - `const`: A compile-time constant, immutable and used for constant values.

4. **Adding Libraries**
   - Integrated essential libraries like:
     - **Hive**: A lightweight and fast key-value database.
     - **Slidable**: A widget for creating sliding actions.

5. **Stateless and Stateful Widgets**
   - **StatelessWidget**: Immutable widgets that do not hold any state.
   - **StatefulWidget**: Widgets that can hold and manage state.

6. **Setting State in Stateful Widgets**
   - Used `setState` to trigger a rebuild of the widget with new data.

7. **Initializing Database Class on Page Mount**
   - Implemented `initState` to initialize the database class when the page mounts.

8. **Creating Custom Widgets and Passing Props**
   - Created custom widgets, such as `TodoTile`, and passed properties like:
     - Todo name
     - Completion state
     - Callback functions

9. **Text Inputs and Controllers**
   - Managed text input fields using `TextEditingController` for better control and manipulation.
