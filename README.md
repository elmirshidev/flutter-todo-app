What I learned in 1 day in flutter and dart:
1)Everything is widget
2)Class based widgeting language
3)Final and Const differences
4)Adding libraries(Hive,slidable)
5)Stateless and Statefull widgets
6)Setting state in statefull widgest(Re rendering)(setState)
7)Initing database class when page mounts(initState)
8)Creating custom widgets and passing props like a TodoTile component(passing todo name,completed state and callback functions)
9)TextInputs and controlling them with TextEditingController
